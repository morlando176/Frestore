    <h3>About Foreskin Restoration</h3>
    <p>Foreskin restoration is the process of expanding the residual skin on the penis to recreate the foreskin which may have been removed by circumcision or other injury. This can be done by tissue expansion using manual methods or devices.</p>
    <p>Tracking your progress is essential for maintaining motivation and adjusting your restoration techniques for optimal results.</p>
